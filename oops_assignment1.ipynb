    "Abstraction is one of the fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs), which focuses on hiding complex implementation details of a system from the user and providing them with a simple interface to interact with it. In other words, Abstraction allows us to focus on the essential features of an object or system, ignoring the irrelevant details.\n",

Instead, we are only interested in the basic functionalities, such as starting the car, accelerating, braking, and turning. Therefore, we can consider a car as an abstraction of its internal mechanisms."
